# WF-007 Add State Migration Hooks And Explicit Upgrade Handlers For Hot-Swap Boundaries

## Goal

Add state migration hooks and explicit upgrade handlers for hot-swap boundaries

## Why

Long-running agent systems need durable state, replay, and supervised self-update before Clasp can claim real autonomy. This task belongs to the Durable Workflows And Hot Swap track.

## Scope

- Implement `WF-007` as one narrow slice of work: Add state migration hooks and explicit upgrade handlers for hot-swap boundaries
- Add or update regression coverage for the new behavior
- Update docs or examples only where the new surface changes visible behavior
- Avoid unrelated refactors or broad rewrites

## Likely Files

- `src/Clasp/`
- `runtime/`
- `examples/`
- `test/Main.hs`
- `docs/`

## Dependencies

- `WF-006`

## Acceptance

- `WF-007` is implemented without breaking previously integrated tasks
- Tests or regressions cover the new behavior
- `bash scripts/verify-all.sh` passes

## Verification

```sh
bash scripts/verify-all.sh
```
