# SA-007 Add Deterministic Seeded App Fixtures For Local Development And Benchmarks

## Goal

Add deterministic seeded app fixtures for local development and benchmarks

## Why

The real test is whether agents can build and evolve a moderate product in Clasp rather than only patch compiler features. This task belongs to the SaaS Dogfooding track.

## Scope

- Implement `SA-007` as one narrow slice of work: Add deterministic seeded app fixtures for local development and benchmarks
- Add or update regression coverage for the new behavior
- If the task changes runtime behavior, trust boundaries, workflows, interop, or app/user-facing execution surfaces, add or update at least one scenario-level or end-to-end verification path
- Update docs or examples only where the new surface changes visible behavior
- Avoid unrelated refactors or broad rewrites

## Likely Files

- `examples/`
- `runtime/`
- `benchmarks/`
- `docs/`
- `test/`

## Dependencies

- `SA-006`

## Acceptance

- `SA-007` is implemented without breaking previously integrated tasks
- Tests or regressions cover the new behavior
- Runtime, boundary, workflow, interop, or app-surface changes are backed by scenario-level or end-to-end verification, not only a local unit-style regression
- `bash scripts/verify-all.sh` passes

## Verification

```sh
bash scripts/verify-all.sh
```
